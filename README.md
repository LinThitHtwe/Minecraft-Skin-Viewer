# Minecraft Skin Viewer

A simple Minecraft 3d skin viewer, similar to [NameMC.com](https://namemc.com), where users can:

- Search for a player by name to view and download their skin.
- Upload their own skin file for preview.
- Toggle different animations such as rotating, walking, and running.
- Customize the field of view (FOV) and background color.
- Add a background image using provided options or by uploading their own.
- Set the background image to panorama mode.

This project is just for fun and not meant to be taken too seriously.

**If you'd like to contribute, you're more than welcome!**
